# SR_ISS_Water_Extraction

Super-resolution water body extraction from Sentinel-2 imagery.

## Introduction

This repository provides the implementation of the SR_ISS framework proposed for super-resolution reconstruction and water body extraction from Sentinel-2 imagery.

The proposed method reconstructs Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery from 10 m / 20 m spatial resolution to 2.5 m spatial resolution based on image self-similarity. The reconstructed SWIR1 band is subsequently used for high-resolution water body extraction.

## Training Workflow

### 1. Create Training Patches

Generate image patches for model training:

```bash
python SR_ISS/training/create_patches.py
```

---

### 2. Generate Random Training Samples

Create randomized training datasets:

```bash
python SR_ISS/training/create_random.py
```

---

### 3. Train the ISS Model

Open and run:

```text
SR_ISS/training/train.ipynb
```

The notebook contains the complete training workflow for the ISS reconstruction model.

Required model files are provided in:

```text
SR_ISS/utils/
```

Due to storage limitations, the Sentinel-2 training datasets are provided via Google Drive:

## Testing and Reconstruction

Example reconstruction workflow:

```text
SR_ISS/testing/experiment.ipynb
```

The reconstruction process performs a single ×2 super-resolution operation at each stage.


In `experiment.ipynb`, the variable `dir_im_high` corresponds to the auxiliary high-resolution imagery (`4328bands`), while `dir_im_low` corresponds to the low-resolution imagery (`10bands`) to be super-resolved at each reconstruction stage.

To obtain the final 2.5 m reconstruction result, the reconstruction procedure must be executed three times sequentially:

1. 20 m → 10 m
   (`E98N34_4328bands_10m_clip4.tif` + `E98N34_10bands_20m_clip4.tif`
   → `E98N34_10bands_10m_clip4.tif`)

2. 10 m → 5 m
   (`E98N34_4328bands_5m_clip4.tif` + `E98N34_10bands_10m_clip4.tif`
   → `E98N34_10bands_5m_clip4.tif`)

3. 5 m → 2.5 m
   (`E98N34_4328bands_2.5m_clip4.tif` + `E98N34_10bands_5m_clip4.tif`
   → `E98N34_10bands_2.5m_clip4.tif`)

The `10bands` data and `4328bands` data should be used together during reconstruction.

At each stage:

* `4328bands` data are used as auxiliary high-resolution imagery
* `10bands` data are progressively super-resolved during reconstruction

After each reconstruction stage, replace the input file path with the generated output from the previous stage before running the next reconstruction step.

Final reconstruction result:

```text
E98N34_4328bands_2.5m_clip4.tif
```

Due to storage limitations, the complete 10 m and 20 m Sentinel-2 testing datasets are provided via Google Drive, while only partial 10 m, 5 m, and 2.5 m sample data are included in `data/test_data` for demonstration and reconstruction examples.

## Water Body Extraction

After super-resolution reconstruction, water body extraction can be performed using:

* MNDWI
* Otsu thresholding

The reconstructed SWIR1 band is used to improve water boundary delineation and reduce mixed-pixel effects.

---

## Notes

* `experiment.ipynb` is provided as an example reconstruction workflow.

* Sentinel-2 imagery used in this study includes:

  * Red
  * Green
  * Blue
  * NIR
  * SWIR1 bands

* The repository focuses on reconstruction and water extraction workflows.
